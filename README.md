---------------------

Creation of a smartphone app that revolutionizes online real estate searches : a fun and entertaining way of surfing the web from an interface such as Google Maps. The user selects his search criteria (location/sale, house/land/apartment/hotels, min/max surfaces, etc.) ; he only has to select and skim over the areas that interest him according to his needs.
The application can also choose to display shops, activities, or access to major roads nearby. Coupled with ARCore software, and furniture sales catalogues, the user can also purchase equipment and/or plan ahead by virtually simulating the layout of his future property. 
The application could also charge a few cents for viewing certain objects or decorations, depending on the trends or new features.
With the aim of gradually leading its users towards the "virtualization" of their various daily tasks, and facilitating the operations of the various real estate agencies for a competitive price with online websites such as «Craig's List » or France's "Leboncoin". This application will be promising of a great evolution, causing a real new order in the real estate sales sector. 

Little by little, the addition of other catalogues and/or services (such as the automation of architectural calculations, the centralization of land registry, layout designs, comparisons of manufacturer specifications, customer opinions, etc.) will be able to enhance this application, offering its users the possibility to buy their ready-to-use real estate directly from their smartphone.

Hello,

My name is Bryan and my friend is Aziz , we are French. We are two to think about this project, we imagined it together.   I often think of looking for new applications that nobody has thought of yet, which could be useful to the greatest number of people.

Most of my ideas are meant to:

-Take virtual the future of a person.
-Control the population / gather information.
-Facility the daily tasks.

For example, I had been thinking of developing a GPS / wallet, which incorporates an automatic payment function for past tolls, parking lots and paid parking for cars.

Thank you



CONTINUATION OF THE IDEA : 
-------------------------


The idea would be to combine several things into one big application:

-Google Maps
-The real estate market
-The cadastres
-A program of construction / renovation / equipment of house / ground
-Google Measure
- Companies and approved shops
-Virtual reality
-The distraction of a video game


In the idea, all these things are related.

-> Google Maps would serve as a benchmark to buy where to sell in real estate.
-> The construction program would serve for people real estate project.
-> Approved companies and shops will be used to feed the application building program.
-> The cadastres will serve as additional useful information on Google Maps.
-> Virtual reality will be used either to project itself into a real estate project, or to play and have fun in virtual projects.
-> The video game will be played on the map of Google Maps made in virtual reality identical to the real one.




GOAL OF THE IDEA:

The idea is to make an application that would be presented as in the menu "Construction of a house" in the game "The Sims" There would be an inventory for the shell, for the second work, for the furnishing, the decoration, the garden ... In short, the materials used for the foundations, up to the style of the doorbell, through the shape of the aquarium and the kind of fish inside, the user will have the ability to create your home from scratch. The app inventory will only offer real and physical items. This will be in summary the global inventory of all the stores and businesses listed on google.

The application will calculate everything to establish its prices when creating a house: Quantity of materials needed, Professional quotes, Manpower ....

The user will have the choice to buy his house at the end of his project or stay in virtual mode.

In which case he buys it, all the orders of articles will be passed near the stores and corresponding companies. Beyond the house, the idea is to also be able to choose the terrain on Google Maps to build it. It would therefore cadastres of all cities, list all the land for sale, and make them appear in green on the Google Maps application.

The idea is that the user can instantly buy his land as his house on the application.

Beyond the "build" mode of the application, the user could visit his house and his land with a VR headset. He will be able to get an idea of ​​the final rendering, and thus make the modifications he wishes.

For those who wish to renovate or resume the construction of an already existing house, it will be necessary that the application is able to model in 3D any type of house thanks to the camera of the smartphone, for integrated the house and its decoration in the application and be able to work on it. The application must recognize each element (size, distance, depth, color, type of materials, furniture, carpentry, carpentry)
The purpose of the application is that the user can create / modify / buy / sell his house and / or his land on the application and he can visit his house in VR. He can for example, invite his friends as in a game.

Each person will be able to create a character, choose his physique or even his clothes. Beyond the real and concrete service offered by the application for real estate projects. The application will have the distracting side of a game since it will be possible to acquire everything in virtual mode.

It will also be possible to create his houses, walk there or still go to friends, even if it has not bought "for real".

One can imagine that in the case of a purely virtual use of the application, the prices of the articles will be free and will pay with virtual money. The application could also offer to buy virtual elements with real money. Imagine that a table costs $ 150 in the case of a real project on the application, the application could for example the proposed $ 0.50 to acquire it in the case of a virtual project. Users will be able to buy their virtual projects at any time to acquire it in real life.

In the more distant future, we could imagine that the application extends to vehicles and public places in virtual reality. Users will walk on Google Maps by car and have a drink together in a virtual bar, get to a virtual job, and still travel virtually.

---------

THE IDEA:

- The idea is to develop an easy-to-use application so that any citizen can create their home from it.

- The app will be connected to the catalogs of hundreds of stores / vendors so that the user has the largest selection of items possible in his MyHouse catalog.

- The MyHouse catalog will be regularly updated to:

1. Submit the catalog of new stores / suppliers.
2. Propose new products from existing stores / suppliers.
3. Adjust real-time prices by stores / suppliers.
4. Delete items at the end of production.

INTEGRATING CONTRACT SOFTWARE:

The application will have to be able to satisfy the needs of customer who owns a project of house to be renovated, for this we can imagine an option which will be able to film each corner of a house with its mobile phone so that it is transcribed in size real on the application, then free to the future renovator to be able to modify his house and create his project.
